# Ansible_team_mp5

THere is the repository with some application developed on the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework - https://github.com/Practical-DevOps/app-for-devops.

The task is to write the `main.yml` Ansible playbook. This playbook should install and configure an Apache server with the application and MariaDB server on two machines with Ubuntu 22.04. Your playbook should adhere to the following requirements:

- web server is included in the group called `[server]` and database server is included in the group `[db]`
- variables named `db_host`, `db_name`, `db_user`, `db_pass` are defined to configure the connection between the application and the database

Here's an example of launching the playbook to install application on an Apache web server with a MariaDB database server:

```bash
ansible-playbook main.yml --extra-vars "db_host=db.some.net db_name=app_db db_user=app_user db_pass=app_pass" -i hosts.ini"
```
